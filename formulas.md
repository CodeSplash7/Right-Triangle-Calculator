if we know a and b:
c = âˆš(a^2 + b^2)
d = c/2 

if we know a and c:
b = sqrt(c^2 - a^2)
d = c/2

if we know b and c:
a = sqrt(c^2 - b^2)
d = c/2

if we know a and d:
c = 2d
b = sqrt(c^2 - a^2)

if we know b and d:
c = 2d
a = sqrt(c^2 - b^2)

if we know c and d:
a = sqrt(2 * d^2)
b = sqrt(d^2 + c^2)
